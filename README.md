knowledgewiki
=============

Inspired by @jjoos I decided to start a Wiki which basically contains annotated bookmarks. Since I Like git repositories better than actual Wiki's it's going to be a repo with Markdown files.

Organisation
============

The organisation is quite freeform. I will add more structure as I see fit. If you think you can improve something, feel free to create a Pull Request, but keep in mind this is mainly my personal minddump, so don't feel too sad when I don't pull ;)

License
=======

Feel free to do anything with this. If you feel like it you could add a reference to this wiki, or say thank you ;)
